# Tetris in C

Tetris made in the C programming language made with the raylib library - University Project

## How to use
Currently you can only compile the game by opening it as a project in Codeblocks that is set up to work with Raylib 3.7.0.
Right now I also provided a .exe file with the game already compiled (if you're brave enough to launch it)
